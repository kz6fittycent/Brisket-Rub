# Turkey Cook

## Brine Ingredients:

- 2 qts chicken broth
- 1/2 cup sea salt (or Kosher salt)
- 1/3 cup brown sugar
- 1 tablespoon of sage
- 1 tablespoon cayenne (for a little kick)
- 2 qts of cold water (or more if needed - turkey must be covered)
- 4 tablespoons of your rub (any rub of your choosing)


## Brine:

- Combine brine ingredients in food safe container and mix

- Place turkey in pot with brine

- Add cold water until turkey is FULLY submerged

- Place in refrigerator for at least 12 hours (24 hours is preferred)


## Prepping for Cooking/Smoking:

- Preheat the oven/smoker to 350F

- Dry - 
    Completely dry the turkey, including allowing it to drip dry as much as possible. This will
    prevent the turkey from being "chewy" and allow the skin to crisp well. 

- Injection - 
    Melt two sticks of butter (unsalted or salted)
    Add 2 tablespoons of your favorite rub to the melted butter and mix
    Inject the turkey with mixture in all major muscles (e.g. breast, thighs, drums, etc)
    
- Oil the skin - 
    Spray the skin with a vegetable oil spray or rub/brush olive oil to completely cover the skin.
    
- Add rub - 
    LIBERALLY apply rub to the internal cavity of the turkey 
        You can also add stuffing or fruit to the cavity to evenly cook the turkey
        
    Add rub to the skin of the turkey to add color and flavor
    
- Cook/Smoke:
    Cook the turkey loosely covered in foil for 1.5 hours (a.k.a. 'tenting')
    Remove the foil 'tent'
    Continue to cook the turkey until the internal temperature reaches 160F in the breast 
        - usually about 3.5 hours TOTAL for ~13lbs bird
        
- Rest time:
    After the turkey has finished cooking, allow it to rest for ~30 minutes
    
## Carve and eat!
