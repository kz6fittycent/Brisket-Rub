# Turkey Cook

## Brine Ingredients:

- 2 qts chicken broth
- 1/2 cup sea salt (or Kosher salt)
- 1/3 cup brown sugar
- 1 tablespoon of sage
- 1 tablespoon cayenne (for a little kick)
- 2 qts of cold water (or more if needed - turkey must be covered)
- 4 tablespoons of your rub (any rub of your choosing)


## Brine:

- Combine brine ingredients in food safe container and mix

- Place turkey in pot with brine

- Add cold water until turkey is FULLY submerged

- Place in refrigerator for at least 12 hours (24 hours is preferred)


## Prepping for Cooking/Smoking:

- Preheat the oven/smoker to 350F

- Dry - 
    - Completely dry the turkey, including allowing it to drip dry as much as possible. This will
    - prevent the turkey from being "chewy" and allow the skin to crisp well. 

- Injection - 
    - Melt two sticks of butter (unsalted or salted)
    
    - Add 2 tablespoons of your favorite rub to the melted butter and mix
    
    - Inject the turkey with mixture in all major muscles (e.g. breast, thighs, drums, etc)
    
- Oil the skin - 
    - Spray the skin with a vegetable oil spray or rub/brush olive oil to completely cover the skin.
    
- Add rub - 
    - LIBERALLY apply rub to the internal cavity of the turkey 
      
        - You can also add stuffing or fruit to the cavity to evenly cook the turkey
        
    - Add rub to the skin of the turkey to add color and flavor
    
- Cook/Smoke:
    - Cook the turkey loosely covered in foil for 1.5 hours (a.k.a. 'tenting')
    
        - Remove the foil 'tent'
        
    - Continue to cook the turkey until the internal temperature reaches 160F in the breast 
        
        - usually about 3.5 hours TOTAL for ~13lbs bird
        
- Rest time:
    - After the turkey has finished cooking, allow it to rest for ~30 minutes
    
## Carve and eat!
