# Brisket-Rub
A simple recipe for brisket rub

# A special note
Ingredients listed below are based on "portions" or "parts", also known as "fractions". As this recipe is meant to be scalable, you'll need to adjust your measurements based on the size of the container you're using. Once you've done it a couple of times, I promise it'll make sense and you'll do it this way forever. 

# Ingredients

Equal parts:
(To equal 2/3 of overall volume)

- Kosher salt
- Course ground black pepper
- Garlic (powder)

Equal parts:
(To equal 1/3 of overall volume)

- Cayenne
- Paprika
- Celery salt/seeds

# Application
After trimming the brisket, apply olive oil to all sides of the brisket, as a binder. With the brisket turned upside-down, liberally apply the rub. Turn brisket right-side up and repeat. 

# Cooking and Serving

Cook/smoke at 250F until internal temperature reaches 160F. Wrap brisket in "red butcher paper". Continue smoking/cooking until internal temp reaches 198F. 

Take brisket away from heat and allow it to rest for at least 2 hours (wrapped). I prefer putting the brisket in a "cooler" as it can help retain some heat for "carry over". 

Once brisket has rested, split the flat from the point and slice against the grain. 

Enjoy!
